title: MAGPIE PUNK | Yelsultong Art Festival | Chungmuro, Seoul, S.Korea
description: |
  I was standing on top of the scaffolding painting this magpie, I looked up and there sitting on the top of the wall directly above me is a magpie staring back at me, the little dude chilled with me for a while before heading off, a nice little seal of approval from the magpie massive!
